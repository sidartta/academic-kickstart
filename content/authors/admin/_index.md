I would describe myself as a curious and passionate introvert with a good balance between intellectual and emotional intelligence. I do not consider myself to be the smartest guy in the room, however, my focus, analytical and problem-solving abilities are clearly my competitive edge. I am also a hard-worker and result-oriented, looking at the word for what it is. I know and love people, their diversity and complexity, and always do my best to lead and learn from them.

I also have a strong technical background with an good understanding of Electromagnetic Theory and a pratical expertise System Engineering as well as a deep interest in Geopolitics, Economy and both Corporate and Market Finance. My goal is to shift my career toward a position where I can better articulate and improve my hard and soft skills. I aim to improve my analytic and synthetic thinking, leadership and problem-solving abilities while supporting businesses build a sustainable growth while improving their value proposition toward their customers and partners.
